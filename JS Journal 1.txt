The course in my opinion is going fairly well. It's easier than I expected but I'm also expecting it to ramp up once we start working with JS frameworks. My previous basic programming experience helps. And whenever I do get stuck my problems are solved fairly quickly.

I am happy with the speed of the course, introducing new concepts that kind of add on to each other. I wouldn't mind if it went a littttle bit faster because I would like to be working with JS and JS frameworks as soon as possible.

I don't have any questions besides wondering when we'd start working with those JS frameworks. There's a pattern you can see here I'm sure. :D
